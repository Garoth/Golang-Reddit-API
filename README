Google Go Reddit API Wrapper
============================

Work in progress wrapper for Reddit's API, as described here:

https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API

This project is not complete and is not in a usable state yet. When it's
done though, you'll be able to write bots and reddit wrappers pretty
trivially with your favourite language. (No promise of completion.)
